## Wireless File Transfer System (WFTS)

### Introduction

**WFTS** is a high-performance wireless file transfer system designed to provide a seamless and efficient file sharing experience. It leverages socket programming to establish direct peer-to-peer connections, enabling rapid file transfer between devices on the same network.

### Key Features:

* **Fast and Reliable:** Utilizes optimized file transfer protocols for maximum speed and stability.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) simplifies file selection and transfer processes.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
* **Secure File Transfer:** Employs encryption techniques to protect sensitive data during transmission.
* **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Minimizes system resource usage to ensure smooth operation.

### How to Use:

1. **Launch the WFTS application:**
   - Double-click the executable file to start the application.
2. **Select a Mode:**
   - Choose either "Send" or "Receive" mode.
3. **Configure Settings:**
   - In "Send" mode, select the file(s) to transfer.
   - In "Receive" mode, specify the destination folder for incoming files.
4. **Connect to a Device:**
   - The application will automatically search for nearby devices.
   - Select the desired device from the list.
5. **Start Transfer:**
   - Click the "Start Transfer" button to initiate the file transfer process.

### Technical Details:

* **Socket Programming:** Employs socket programming to establish direct peer-to-peer connections between devices.
